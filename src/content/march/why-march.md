# why march

i have some late night thoughts saved in my apple notes and my personal to-dos are somewhere in a notion doc and work to-dos is in linear, some urls are dumped in slack:me and some are saved via notion clipper which i never re-open and i sometimes write journals but i don't have any accountiblity on them.

— i manually collect todos/action items and write them down in my daily plan.

— i rarely re-open/ forget things i saved for later such as a blog to read or a article that i must read.

— i loose forcus, switch context while juggling between tools.

— i need a simple tool that works with the speed of thoughts.

sounds familiar ?
