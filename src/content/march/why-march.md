# why march

i have some late night thoughts saved in my apple notes and my personal to-dos are somewhere in a notion doc and work to-dos is in linear, some urls are dumped in slack:me and some are saved via notion clipper which i never re-open and i sometimes write journals but i don't know where are they. 

sounds familiar ?
