# why march

In today's generation, the to-dos do not look like ' water the plants'  or 'write a doc' they have many kinds such as an article my friend shared, a twitter bookmark I saved to check later, a github issue that I was assigned to, a linear ticket. or a message in slack. e.t.c

Let's call them action items which are scattered across places/ tools.

— the tools such as todoist, notion or obsidian are mostly database tools and built on the foundation of organising, writing. read their hero title and come back here.

yeah of course, those are important but what's more important or matters? it's  " if you're getting things done" right? 

— a note, an url, a linear issue, a reminder, bookmark, a code snippet, a mention in slack, a Pull request, a late night thought, these data makes our a second brain isn't it? 

— since the action items are in a different silos, it's hard to put a workflow to actually consume them.

— these tools do not understand us, they don't give any insights about my capacity or help to get more done?

So, we built march from the ground up on the foundation to get things done, a second brain that helps you process and keep everything together in a single place.

everything just two key strokes away.
